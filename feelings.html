        Hi SweetHeart.....! <br><br>
        When I saw you for the first time,
        you seems something Special to me.<br><br>
        As the days goes, you get closer to me.<br><br>
        I don't know the reason why your thoughts
        always resonates inside my mind.<br><br>
        Everything about you is always interesting
        for me.<br><br>
        I am somewhat nervous Because I haven't
        said these words to anyone and I won't say
        to anyone in future.<br><br>
        I Love my Parents so much than anything
        else in this world.<br><br>
        Now You are the only person whom I love
        equally with my parents.<br><br>
         <br><br><br><br>
         I have died a thousand days waiting for you......
         Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you for thousand years<br><br><br>
         Let's show the world that love doesn't become a distractions.Let's be successful together and show the world they are wrong...
<br><br>I want to be yours forever and ever....
        Give me One chance to Prove my Love ...!<br><br>
